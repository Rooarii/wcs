Charter of an Effective Learner
===============================

For the 2020 september [Wild Code School](https://www.wildcodeschool.com/fr-FR) session I commit to :

### My commitments

1. Wake up early with enthusiasm.

2. Plan the main objectives, tasks at the beginning of the week and  try to distirbute the work over the week. 
    - Do the same for the day.

3. Work in **harmony** in the team with the team, and for the team.

    As @Alexandre Dumas said: 
    > un pour tous, tous pour un
      

4. Review mentally what I've learned and make a review sheets (with diagrams, explanations and so on) as much as possible.

5. Practice ***yoga***  🧘 on a daily basis.

6. Take some quality time with my family 👨‍👩‍👦.
