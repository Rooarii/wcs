Charter of an Effective Learner
===============================

Hi to you friend developer, my name is Rooarii  i am **40 %** perfectionist, **40 % wild** (rebel) and **20 %** intelectual. I understand things mostly in a visual way and also by experiencing them.

For the 2020 september [Wild Code School](https://www.wildcodeschool.com/fr-FR) session I commit to :

### My commitments

1. Wake up early with enthusiasm.

2. Plan the main objectives, tasks at the beginning of the week and  try to distirbute the work over the week. 
    - Do the same for the day.

3. Work in **harmony** in the team with the team, and for the team.

    As @Alexandre Dumas said: 
    > un pour tous, tous pour un
      

4. Review mentally what I've learned and make a review sheets (with diagrams, explanations and so on) as much as possible.

5. Practice ***yoga***  🧘 twice a week (it's more realistic).

6. Take some quality time with my family 👨‍👩‍👦.

+ To all my fellow co-workers i wish you all good luck and **May the force be with you! ＜=(⬤‿⬤)=＞**

```
